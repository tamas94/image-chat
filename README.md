# image-chat

<h4>The purpose of this app</h4>
    This is a basic chat application. But a slightly unsual one. Instead of regular text messages, you communicate with images.
    That is, images are used to hold the actual text message.
    You just type in your message and then choose an appropiate image. Your partner gets the image along with your public key
    so they can reveal the hidden message. 
    After the conversation the images (along with the messages) are going to get destroyed. This is all for security and privacy reasons 
    
    
<h5>Image Steganography script</h5>
  Make the given text message encrypted in a visual manner. The user feed's the message for the script and selects
    a suitable image (one which could hold the information). The output will be visually the same selected image
    but with the message hidden inside of it.
